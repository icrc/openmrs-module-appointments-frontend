# ICRC fork

This is a fork from https://github.com/Bahmni/openmrs-module-appointments-frontend to be able to use appointment frontend on a OpenMRS distro and not only on a Bahmni installation.
the main branch is `main_icrc`.

Openmrs Module Appointment Dashboard
=
This repository is extracted appointments module from [openmrs-module-bahmniapps](https://github.com/bahmni/openmrs-module-bahmniapps).
This repository acts as the front end for the **Bahmni Appointment Scheduling**. It is written in **React** and **Angular**.
## Differences with OpenMRS-Module-bahmniapps
We have moved away from bower and installing dependencies from NPM.
Below has been the changes in libraries from `OpenMRS-Module-bahmniapps`

| Library | Change |
| ------  | ------------------- |
| ngDialog| Using `ng-dialog` instead (Rename). |
| jquery.cookie@1.4.0 | Upgraded to `1.4.1` since the existing version is not present in `NPM`. Manually changed the line 12 from `define(['jquery/jquery'], factory);` instead of `define(['jquery'], factory);`. [Reference link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/679#issuecomment-247928334)|
| angular-ui-router | Renamed to `@uirouter/angularjs`. |
| angular-bindonce | Using directly from github since the latest is not published in `NPM`. |
| ngInfiniteScroll@1.3.1 | Using `ng-infinite-scroll@1.3.0`, since this is the latest version on `NPM`. According to this [thread](https://github.com/sroze/ngInfiniteScroll) there are no code changes between `1.3.0` to `1.3.4`. |
| jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.min | Using `jquery-ui-bundle@1.11.4` since the `jquery-ui` is not bundled by default. `1.11.4` is the oldest version on `NPM`  |

* Images for scss are being served in bundled.

## Global variables from library
Few libraries(angular, jquery) used in BahmniApps export themselves as global variables. Webpack doesn't support the idea of global variables by default. All these global variables are exported using `webpack.ProvidePlugin`. Check the `webpack.config.js` plugins section.

## Other Fixes
* According to [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2049), `webpack` doesn't work well with `angular 1`. There has been a fix provided for them using `exports-loader`. There were similar issues for `jquery 1`.

## Duplicate code
* Duplicated `error-routehandler`. It is a small utility and need not to be extracted in library. If we are putting more stuff, it can go to a library.
* Duplicated `openmrs-module-bahmniapps/ui/app/common/constants.js`. This can be merged with `appointments/constants.js`

## Running it with bahmni
* Clone the repo
* Go to UI folder and install dependencies `cd ui && npm install`
* Switch back to root folder `cd ..`
* Run `npm install`
* RUN `npm run build`
* Take a backup of `/var/www/bahmniapps/appointments`.(vagrant)
* Replace content of `/var/www/bahmniapps/appointments` with generated `dist` folder content.(Vagrant)
* Go to bahmni Appointment scheduling UI. It should serve new appointments content.  

## Running Tests
